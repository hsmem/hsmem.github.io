<p>Here&#39;s me holding the Coastal Cup up with Tyler Andree. It&#39;s just a local team prize, nothing actually impressive. What&#39;s shocking about this photo is how young Tyler looks, and how young I look, and that this is just months before Mia and I started seeing flirting at swim practice.</p>

<p>Practice was a big part of my life at this point. I spent up to 5 or 6 hours at the pool some days. Half my friends swam. Soon I&#39;d be dating another swimmer. </p>

<p>Half my memories are from the pool. The nosebleeds at one point. So many sets, so many times at the gutter feeling ready to vomit, slumping up on the deck half-immersed. So many minutes in hot tubs, holding the breath, flirting, upholding strange male hierarchies.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one of just Clare and I. She wore five-and-a-half inch heels that dance so that she was nearly the same height as me. </p>

<p>I remember some of the guy friends sophomore year, when we walked off to Scolari&#39;s for Arizonas and snacks at lunch, would give me shit for my voice cracking. &quot;Are you on your period Graham?&quot; or they&#39;d mime the voice as if they were me, &quot;Clare, can I borrorow a tampon?&quot;</p>

<p>My sophomore year I was in a piano class with Faith Kenny (of Kenny apple orchard fame), Chris Toh, Hannah Sada, Cooper Jamison, Maddy Perello, others. Here&#39;s me with Chris, goofing off in the piano room. I was believe I was being the &quot;piano girl.&quot; Faith and I were so into each other, and I never realized it until after.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also wearing this Volcom jacket I loved, that my dad found in the lost-and-found at his work, Nipomo High School, where he was a government and leadership teacher.</p>

<p>This is me with Benji (or Luke) Owen. Luke was originally named Benjamin, but changed his name at 7 to Luke after Luke Skywalker. </p>

<p>Benji and I knew each other at five at Pacheco, and got to be really close around 8 and 9. Then he went to Germany for two years, fifth and sixth grade, where his dad was teaching abroad as an engineering prof. Everything got so stratified socially when middle school came about that we didn&#39;t become friends again when he came back; it was only a few years later that we reconnected.</p>

<p>We&#39;re both wearing T-shirts made by Benji&#39;s neighbor, who printed under the name Genuine Stolen. His is of the Blues Brothers, mine is a watermelon-color paper airplane.</p>

<p>This is me with Nate Sepulveda, another swimmer on our club team. We&#39;re either doing a relay or (equally likely) I was in a heat before him. Either way I&#39;ve already swum if my cap&#39;s off. </p>

<p>I remember we were at this meet somewhere in Los Angeles, maybe Long Beach or even Pasadena, when we drove past Sepulveda Blvd in L.A.. We were in the van together carpooling down with our coach, and I remember making a comment about the shared name. I think it was only a few years ago I realized what a major street that is down south, and how well-known it is.</p>

<p>I controlled the Aux cord on that trip, and I remember a fair amount of Strokes and Justice.</p>

<p>I got unfathomably sick that trip. I had strep later and this was a factor of ten worse. We actually went in for strep tests and they came out negative. I remember my coach, Rich, who was down at the A.G. branch of our club, spent a fair amount of time driving me around between sessions, looking for a pharmacy. I got prescribed lidocaine, a topical analgesic. I couldn&#39;t get water down without it. Even with it, I was confined to smoothies and juice for a weekend. I still have no idea what caused it or what it was.</p>

<p>The caption here is &quot;Lights out!&quot; and the photographer is my primary coach at PUMA Swim Club. Next to me left-to-right is Nate Sepulveda, Peter Malouf, and Russel Peterson. Peter and I stopped talking a couple years later. He was a pretty devout Christian, and it came out through a turn of events that he found out I&#39;d slept with Mia, with whom he was in love.  I always saw us as good friends before then. We considered working on music together but his elbow always had too much tendinitis to play guitar like he used to. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not actually in the photo, but this was at one point the record-holding team in the 4x100 free at SLO High. They had graduated a couple years ahead, and had a butterflier that had also set records at the school. I got tagged by my relaymates, Jake O&#39;Connor, Eric Erbstoesser, and Zach Flachman, because we had plans to take that record down. We ended up doing it, and then my team the year after one-upped it again by a significant margin. Those relays were some of the most fun I&#39;ve ever had in my life, the most I&#39;ve lost myself and most charged a moment has felt. There&#39;s a sense of meaning, purpose, motivation, comraderie. And a lot of adrenaline. I anchored every race, which meant that the outcome of the race, the record, and oftentimes a league championship came down to how I swam. Nothing feels better than this, and nothing feels worse than when you can&#39;t make a miracle happen.</p>

<p>Dominic Magliari took this photo. He was a few years older. I remember my freshman year, I bonded with him at CIF in a hotel room one night, around one or two in the morning, as we lied in bed in the darkness and he told me about sexual frustrations he had. </p>

<p>Everyone in this photo is wearing their Yellows. That&#39;s the name of the thirty y/o tracksuit we&#39;re all wearing, passed down from the seventies and kept in a big shed out by the Sinsheimer Pool where we practiced. </p>

<p>We&#39;re at Sinsheimer here, a home meet. Swimmers sat on the bleachers according to team: girls varsity on the left, down below; boys varsity on the right, down below; same with junior varsity up top. Varsity got the bottom of the bleachers because it was convenient, and because sometimes the meets&#39; fast pace meant that swimmers would be caught unaware about an impending race of theirs. They&#39;d sprint down, tearing off clothes, often putting on goggles and a cap on the blocks while taking their marks. It was more important that varsity make their events, and every second mattered.</p>

<p>In the back you can see Eric Erbstoesser, or &quot;Erb,&quot; talking to Alan Peterson. They were best friends all high school. I hope they still are.</p>

<p>I fucking hated everyone in this photo. Andrew Jess, R.J. HAssey, Jake Niezen, Jack something. I&#39;m Ariana&#39;s date; she&#39;s in black and pearls on the left, laughing. Rachel&#39;s going with Kyle Sweazey, who she&#39;d later lose her virginity to. She&#39;s hard to see, but she&#39;s behind the light-<br>
gray-suited guy in the center, head turned, blonde hair. Kyle&#39;s kneeling on the lower left.</p>
